# Face Detection Model on Raspberry Pi 3 for Aligarh Smart City Module

This project implements a face detection model using a Raspberry Pi 3 to enhance security and monitoring within the Aligarh Smart City initiative. The model captures real-time video feeds, processes them for face detection, and can be integrated with various applications for smart city functionalities.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection:** Utilizes Haar Cascades and OpenCV for accurate face recognition in video feeds.
- **Raspberry Pi 3 Compatibility:** Designed specifically to run efficiently on Raspberry Pi 3 hardware.
- **Integration Ready:** Can be integrated with smart city applications for security monitoring and data analysis.
- **Low Latency Processing:** Optimized for quick processing to enable real-time monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Primary programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV** - Library for computer vision tasks and image processing.
- **Raspberry Pi 3** - Hardware platform for running the model.
- **Haar Cascades** - Pre-trained classifiers for detecting faces.

## Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kzohan2000/Face-Detection-Model-on-Raspberry-Pi-3-for-Aligarh-Smart-City-Module.git
   cd Face-Detection-Model-on-Raspberry-Pi-3-for-Aligarh-Smart-City-Module
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed on your Raspberry Pi:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
   ```

3. **Run the Face Detection Model**

   Use the following command to execute the model:

   ```bash
   python3 face_detection.py
   ```

4. **Access the Video Feed**

   The model will begin processing the video feed from the Raspberry Pi camera, detecting faces in real time.

## Usage

- **Detection Feedback:** Detected faces will be highlighted in the video feed, allowing for easy monitoring.
- **Integration:** The model can be further enhanced to integrate with databases or alert systems for added functionalities.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement facial recognition capabilities.
- Integrate with cloud services for data storage and analysis.
- Optimize model performance for additional features like emotion detection.
